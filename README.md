## Creating a New Repository
If you want to reuse code from this year in a new repository, follow these steps:
1. Create an empty repository.
2. Create a cloned local repository.
3. Add a remote called "origin" pointing to the new GitHub repository and delete any other remotes if present.
4. In the terminal, run "git push origin --force".
